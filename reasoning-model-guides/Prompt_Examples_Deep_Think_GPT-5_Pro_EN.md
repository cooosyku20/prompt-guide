## 5) Code Review (Bug Detection / Single Text Input)

### üß† Deep Think Version (Copy-Paste Ready)
```
You are an elite software quality engineer and security reviewer.
Objective: Systematically identify latent bugs from "project structure + all source code" in single text input, providing fix recommendations.

Input (paste entire project in PROJECT block below):
<PROJECT>
{Paste "folder/file structure" and "complete source of each file" here}
</PROJECT>

Approach and tasks:
- Internally evaluate multiple perspectives (correctness/security/concurrency/error-handling/performance/resource-leaks/portability/i18n/API-misuse/dependencies) in parallel, output optimal findings only. Exclude thinking processes.
- Infer file boundaries from file names, tree notation, ```lang ...``` fences, "BEGIN/END FILE" markers, etc.
- Attach file_path and line numbers (start_line‚Äìend_line, relative to each file start) when possible.
- Consolidate duplicates from same root cause into single item with affected locations list.

Output (this order, this format):
1) Overview (50‚Äì120 chars): Main risk areas and anticipated impact
2) Severity definitions (example):
   - **Critical**: Production outage, data breach, arbitrary code execution requiring immediate response. High reproducibility with **no workarounds**, or major legal/compliance risks.
   - **High**: Core function failures, serious security flaws (auth/authz gaps, injection). **Temporary workarounds available** but release-blocking.
   - **Medium**: Limited condition failures/data inconsistency/notable performance regression/error handling gaps. **Workarounds available** for continued operation. Fix in next release.
   - **Low**: Minor behavior/safety issues (logging gaps, deprecated APIs, inappropriate monitoring thresholds). **Appearance/style-only** excluded.
3) Top N critical findings (N‚â§{10})
   - id: BUG-xxx
   - severity: {Critical|High|Medium|Low}
   - category: {correctness|security|concurrency|performance|reliability|portability|i18n|api-misuse|dependency|other}
   - file_path: relative path
   - lines: L{start}-L{end}
   - finding: What's wrong (1‚Äì2 sentences)
   - evidence: Minimal code excerpt (3‚Äì12 lines)
   - why: Why it's buggy/vulnerable (‚â§3 key points)
   - repro: Reproduction steps or failure scenario (concise/pseudo-input OK)
   - fix: Minimal fix approach (1‚Äì3 sentences)
   - diff: Unified diff if possible (relevant hunks only)
   - tests: Tests to add (boundary/worst-case, one line each)
4) Affected locations list (only when duplicates consolidated)
5) Early remediation priorities (bulleted with rationale)

Constraints:
- No full input re-display. Minimal excerpts only.
- Mark speculation-based findings as "assumption: ‚Ä¶"
- Exclude style-only topics (prioritize behavior/safety impact).
- Keep technical terms as-is.
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è GPT-5 Pro Version (Copy-Paste Ready)
````
You are a bug detection engineer. Detect latent bugs from single text "project structure + all source code" and return as structured JSON with minimal diffs.
No thinking processes in output. No verbose explanations.

Input (paste in PROJECT block below):
<PROJECT>
{Paste "folder/file structure" and "complete source of each file" here}
</PROJECT>

Requirements:
- Analysis perspectives: correctness, security, concurrency, error-handling, performance, resource-leak, portability, i18n, api-misuse, dependency
- Consolidate same-pattern issues into 1 item, listing all affected locations in `locations[]`
- Line numbers relative within files as `start_line` / `end_line`
- Return strictly compliant to following JSON schema (**JSON ONLY, no other output**)

JSON Schema (fixed key names/order):
{
  "summary": {
    "highlights": ["Main risk areas, max 3 points, each ‚â§120 chars"],

- File paths, line numbers, minimal excerpts for evidence and reproducibility
- Hidden thinking processes, conclusions and evidence only

- Deep Think: **Audit report format** (overview ‚Üí definitions ‚Üí top N ‚Üí priorities) for human decision-making
- GPT-5 Pro: **Strict JSON + diff** for automated ticketing/CI integration
- Deep Think: Emphasizes "why/how to fix" in readable text
- GPT-5 Pro: Prioritizes schema compliance and minimal verbosity
